Under the parallel lines regression model, the age-adjusted death rate due to heart disease (\texttt{Heart}) increases by $0.4052$ for every one unit increase in the bank clerk speed (\texttt{Bank}) (95\% confidence interval from $0.0037$ to $0.8067$). Similarly, \texttt{Heart} increases by $.4516$ for every one unit increase in the pedestrian walking speed (\texttt{Walk}) (95\% confidence interval from $0.0424$ to $0.8608$). The data provides no evidence that \texttt{Heart} is associated with postal clerk talking speed (\texttt{Talk}) (two sided p-value = $0.4249$ for a test that the \texttt{Talk} coefficient is zero).

\part \textit{Draw a coded scatterplot of proportion of pollen removed versus duration of visit; use different symbols or letters as the plotting codes for queens and workers. Does it appear that the relationship between proportion removed and duration is a straight line?}

A scatterplot of proportion of pollen removed versus duration of visit, by bee type is shown in Figure \ref{fig:2a}. It does not appear that the relationship between proportion removed and duration is a straight line.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}

\part \textit{The logit transformation is often useful for proportions between 0 and 1. If p is the proportion then the logit is $\log[p/(1-p)]$. This is the log of the ratio of the amount of pollen removed to the amount not removed. Draw a coded scatterplot of the logit versus duration.}

A scatterplot of the logit of proportion of pollen removed versus duration of visit, by bee type is shown in Figure \ref{fig:2b}.

\end{figure}


\part \textit{Draw a coded scatterplot of the logit versus log duration. From the three plots, which transformations appear to be worthy of pursuing with a regression model?}

A scatterplot of the logit of proportion of pollen removed versus the log duration of visit, by bee type is shown in Figure \ref{fig:2c}. The Logit(PollenRemoved) vs Log(DurationOfVisit) transformations produce the most linear relationship, and is worthy of pursuing with a regression model.

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\captionsetup{width=0.8\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=4.25in]{2c.png}

\part \textit{Fit the multiple linear regression of the logit of the proportion of pollen removed on (i) log duration, (ii) an indicator variable for whether the bee is a queen or a worker, and (iii) a product term for the interaction of the first two explanatory variables. By examining the p-value of the interaction term, determine whether there is any evidence that the proportion of pollen depends on duration of visit differently for queens than for workers.}

The large p-value ($0.342$) of the interaction term (\texttt{LogDurationOfVisit:BeeTypeWorker}) indicates there is little evidence to suggest that the proportion of pollen removed depends on the duration of visit differently for queens than it does for workers.

\begin{codeSmall}

\end{codeSmall}$


\part \textit{Refit the multiple regression but without the interaction term. Is there evidence that, after accounting for the amount of time on the flower, queens tend to remove a smaller proportion of pollen than workers? Why is the p-value for the significance of the indicator variable so different in this model than in the one with the interaction term?}

After accounting for the amount of time on the flower, there is moderate evidence that queen bees tend to remove a smaller proportion of pollen than worker bees. On average, worker bees remove $0.5697$ more pollen (on the logit scale) than queen bees after accounting for time on the flower (95\% confidence interval $0.0932$ to $1.0462$; two sided p-value = $0.0202$ for a test that the \texttt{BeeTypeWorker} coefficient is zero).

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmPollenNoInt <- lm(formula=LogitPollenRemoved ~ LogDurationOfVisit + BeeType,
+                data=pollenData)
> summary(lmPollenNoInt)$coefficients
                     Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)        -2.7145967  0.3842293 -7.065043 9.179776e-09
LogDurationOfVisit  0.8885650  0.1401728  6.339068 1.070189e-07
BeeTypeWorker       0.5696676  0.2364278  2.409478 2.022607e-02
\end{codeSmall}$

In this model, the indicator variable \texttt{BeeTypeWorker} has a different meaning than in the model that included the interaction term. Without the interaction term, the coefficient on \texttt{BeeTypeWorker} measures how much more pollen a worker bee extracts from a flower than a queen bee. When the interaction term is included, though, the coefficient on \texttt{BeeTypeWorker} still measures how much more pollen a worker bee extracts from a flower than a queen bee, but must account for the fact that difference can now depend on the duration. Since there's little evidence to suggest that duration has an impact on the proportion of pollen removed, the inclusion of that interaction term decreases the strength of the model. The p-value for the significance of \texttt{BeeTypeWorker} is thus lower in this model than it is in the model that includes the interaction term.

\part \textit{Construct a scatterplot of average wing size against latitude, in which the four groups defined by continent and sex are coded differently. Do these suggest that the wing sizes of the NA flies have evolved toward the same cline as in EU?}

A scatterplot of average wing size vs latitude, by continent and sex is shown in Figure \ref{fig:3a}. From the scatterplot, it appears that the wing sizes of the NA flies have evolved toward a similar cline as in the EU.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\end{figure}



\part \textit{Construct a multiple linear regression model with wing size as the response, with latitude as a linear explanatory variable, and with indicator variables to distinguish the sexes and continents. As there are four groups, you will want to have three indicator variables: the continent indicator, the sex indicator, and the product of the two. Construct the model in such a way that one parameter measures the difference between the slopes of the wing size versus latitude regressions of NA and EU for males, one measures the difference between the NA-EU slope difference for females and that for males, one measures the difference between the intercepts of the regressions of NA and EU for males, and one measures the difference between the NA-EU intercepts' difference for females and that for males.}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{Latitude:ContinentNA} measures the difference between the slopes of the wing size versus latitude regressions of NA and EU for males,
\item \texttt{Latitude:SexFemales:ContinentNA} measures the difference between the NA-EU slope difference for females and that for males,
\item \texttt{ContinentNA} measures the difference between the intercepts of the regressions of NA and EU for males, and

\part \textit{Quantify the amount (in seconds or miles per hour) by which the mean winning time or speed on fast tracks exceeds the mean on slow tracks (using the two-category variable Conditions), after accounting for the effect of year.}

To find the quantity of interest, we perform a regression of Speed on Year, Year$^2$, and Conditions.

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmDerbyB <- lm(formula=Speed ~ Year + Year2 + Conditions, data=derbyData)

                    Estimate   Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)

\end{codeSmall}$

After accounting for the effect of year, there is overwhelming evidence that the mean winning speed on fast tracks is greater than the mean on slow tracks. On average, the winning speed on fast tracks is $0.9861$ miles/hour greater than the winning speed on slow tracks (95\% confidence interval $0.7902$ to $1.1820$ miles/hour; two sided p-value = $3.76 \times 10^{-17}$ for a test that the \texttt{ConditionsSlow} coefficient is zero).

\part \textit{After accounting for the effects of year and track conditions, is there any evidence that the mean winning time or speed depends on number of horses in the race (Starters)? Is there any evidence of an interactive effect of Starters and Conditions; that is, does the effect of number of horses on the response depend on whether the track was fast or slow? Describe the effect of number of horses on mean winning time or speed.}

To find the quantities of interest, we perform a regression of Speed on Year, Year$^2$, Conditions, Starters, and the interaction between Conditions and Starters.

After accounting for the effects of year and track conditions, there is moderate evidence that the mean winning speed depends on the number of horses in the race. On average, for each additional horse in a race, the winning speed decreases by $0.0250$ miles/hour (95\% confidence interval $0.0035$ to $0.0465$ miles/hour; two sided p-value = $0.0233$ for a test that the \texttt{ConditionsSlow} coefficient is zero).

There is no evidence that the effect of number of horses on speed depends on whether the track was fast or slow. The interaction term between Conditions and Starters has a two sided p-value of $0.3766$ for a test that the \texttt{ConditionsSlow:Starters} coefficient is zero.

\part \textit{the number of tropical storms} \label{prob:1028a}

We first test a model that describes the effect of \texttt{Temperature} (an ordinal-equivalent variable of \texttt{ElNino}), \texttt{WestAfrica}, and their interaction, on the number of tropical storms (\texttt{Storms}).

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmNinoA1 <- lm(formula=Storms ~ Temperature * WestAfrica, data=ninoData)
> summary(lmNinoA1)$coefficients
                         Estimate Std. Error    t value     Pr(>|t|)

\end{codeSmall}$

A plot of the residuals vs fitted values reveals a horn-shaped pattern, and a plot of the residuals vs year indicates the presence of serial correlation (here, a likely (quadratic) association between \texttt{Year} and \texttt{Storms}). Both plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:6a1_resid_serial}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\label{fig:6a1_resid_serial}
\end{figure}

Incorporating a quadratic association between \texttt{Storms} and \texttt{Year}, another model is shown below.

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmNinoA2 <- lm(formula=Storms ~ Temperature * WestAfrica + Year + I(Year^2), data=ninoData)
> summary(lmNinoA2)$coefficients
                            Estimate   Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)

The plots of residuals vs fitted values and of residuals vs year shown in Figure \ref{fig:6a2_resid_serial} indicates that the inclusion of the \texttt{Year} terms has resolved both the horn-shaped pattern and much of the serial correlation issue.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\captionsetup{width=0.8\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{6a2_resid_serial.png}
	\caption{Model A2: (Left) A plot of residuals vs fitted values. (Right) A plot of residuals vs \texttt{Year}.}
	\label{fig:6a2_resid_serial}
\end{figure}

After accounting for the effect of year: There is overwhelming evidence that the mean number of storms is associated with temperature (two sided p-value = $0.000446$ for a test that the \texttt{Temperature} coefficient is zero). On average, cold El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==-1}) have 2.5 additional storms/year than neutral El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==0}), which have 2.5 additional storms/year than warm El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==1}) (95\% confidence interval $1.1763$ to $3.8243$ additional storms/year). There is suggestive, but inconclusive evidence that wet years in West Africa (\texttt{WestAfrica==1}) are associated with $1.797$ additional storms per year (two sided p-value = $0.0856$ for a test that the \texttt{WestAfrica} coefficient is zero; 95\% confidence interval $-0.2632$ to $3.8578$ additional storms/year). There is no evidence that the effect of temperature on the number of storms depends on whether it was a wet or dry year in West Africa (two sided p-value = $0.1442$ for a test that the \texttt{Temperature:WestAfrica} coefficient is zero).




\part \textit{the number of hurricanes} \label{prob:1028b}

We first fit a model that describes the effect of \texttt{Temperature}, \texttt{WestAfrica}, and their interaction, on the number of hurricanes (\texttt{Hurricanes}).

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmNinoB1 <- lm(formula=Hurricanes ~ Temperature * WestAfrica, data=ninoData)
> summary(lmNinoB1)$coefficients
                         Estimate Std. Error   t value     Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)             5.2552783  0.3811964 13.786275 1.417450e-17
Temperature            -1.0940499  0.4789968 -2.284044 2.725047e-02
WestAfrica              1.1771541  0.6521561  1.805019 7.791770e-02
Temperature:WestAfrica -0.3654096  0.7855737 -0.465150 6.441181e-01
\end{codeSmall}$

A plot of the residuals vs fitted values reveals no issues with the model, and a plot of the residuals vs year does not reveal any serial correlation, as it did in part (a). Both plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:6b1_resid_serial}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\captionsetup{width=0.8\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{6b1_resid_serial.png}
	\caption{Model B1: (Left) A plot of residuals vs fitted values. (Right) A plot of residuals vs \texttt{Year}.}
	\label{fig:6b1_resid_serial}
\end{figure}


There is moderate evidence that the mean number of hurricanes is associated with temperature (two sided p-value = $0.0273$ for a test that the \texttt{Temperature} coefficient is zero). On average, cold El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==-1}) have 1.0940 additional hurricanes/year than neutral El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==0}), which have 1.0940 additional hurricanes/year than warm El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==1}) (95\% confidence interval $0.1287$ to $2.0594$ additional hurricanes/year). There is suggestive, but inconclusive evidence that wet years in West Africa (\texttt{WestAfrica==1}) are associated with $1.1772$ additional hurricanes per year (two sided p-value = $0.0779$ for a test that the \texttt{WestAfrica} coefficient is zero; 95\% confidence interval $-0.1372$ to $2.4915$ additional hurricanes/year). There is no evidence that the effect of temperature on the number of hurricanes depends on whether it was a wet or dry year in West Africa (two sided p-value = $0.6441$ for a test that the \texttt{Temperature:WestAfrica} coefficient is zero).


\part \textit{the storm index} \label{prob:1028c}

We first test a model that describes the effect of \texttt{Temperature}, \texttt{WestAfrica}, and their interaction, on the storm index (\texttt{StormIndex}).

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmNinoC1 <- lm(formula=StormIndex ~ Temperature * WestAfrica, data=ninoData)
> summary(lmNinoC1)$coefficients
                        Estimate Std. Error    t value     Pr(>|t|)
(Intercept)             82.85413   7.581316 10.9287267 4.024245e-14
Temperature            -24.94626   9.526391 -2.6186472 1.206303e-02
WestAfrica              43.91344  12.970221  3.3857125 1.503487e-03
Temperature:WestAfrica -10.79428  15.623658 -0.6908935 4.932615e-01
\end{codeSmall}$

A plot of the residuals vs fitted values reveals a moderate horn-shaped pattern, and a plot of the residuals vs year indicates the presence of serial correlation (here, a likely (quadratic) association between \texttt{Year} and \texttt{StormIndex}). Both plots are shown in Figure \ref{fig:6c1_resid_serial}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

	\captionsetup{width=0.8\textwidth}
	\includegraphics[width=5.5in]{6c1_resid_serial.png}
	\caption{Model C1: (Left) A plot of residuals vs fitted values. (Right) A plot of residuals vs \texttt{Year}.}
	\label{fig:6c1_resid_serial}
\end{figure}

Incorporating a quadratic association between \texttt{StormIndex} and \texttt{Year}, another model is shown below.

\begin{codeSmall}
> lmNinoC2 <- lm(formula=StormIndex ~ Temperature * WestAfrica + Year + I(Year^2), data=ninoData)
> summary(lmNinoC2)$coefficients
                            Estimate   Std. Error    t value    Pr(>|t|)

The plots of residuals vs fitted values and of residuals vs year shown in Figure \ref{fig:6c2_resid_serial} indicates that the inclusion of the \texttt{Year} terms has resolved both the horn-shaped pattern and much of the serial correlation issue.

	\caption{Model C2: (Left) A plot of residuals vs fitted values. (Right) A plot of residuals vs \texttt{Year}.}
	\label{fig:6c2_resid_serial}
\end{figure}

After accounting for the effect of year: There is overwhelming evidence that the mean storm index is associated with temperature (two sided p-value = $0.00150$ for a test that the \texttt{Temperature} coefficient is zero). On average, cold El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==-1}) have a storm index of 31.46 points higher than neutral El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==0}), which have a storm index of 31.46 points higher than warm El Nino years (\texttt{Temperature==1}) (95\% confidence interval $12.76$ to $50.15$ points higher). There is moderate evidence that wet years in West Africa (\texttt{WestAfrica==1}) are associated with a storm index $31.80$ points higher than dry years (two sided p-value = $0.03288$ for a test that the \texttt{WestAfrica} coefficient is zero; 95\% confidence interval $2.714$ to $60.89$ points). There is no evidence that the effect of temperature on storm index depends on whether it was a wet or dry year in West Africa (two sided p-value = $0.73694$ for a test that the \texttt{Temperature:WestAfrica} coefficient is zero).
